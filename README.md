quotes-manager
==============

An example of a Angularjs REST client

This is a companion app for the REST server created here:
https://github.com/gregmercer/quotes-server

To run the client:

1. download and unzip this repository
2. cd into the quotes-manager directory
3. node web-server.js (this will run a node-based web server on your localhost)
4. open a broswer to this address: http://localhost:8000/index.html

Live long and prosper. Peace out.
